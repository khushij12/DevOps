## What is DevOps?
DevOps is a combination of the words development and operations. It isn't meant to leave out other teams. Dev is traditionally understood to mean everyone usually on the code side, from developers to front end designers to QA and ops is generally understood include everyone traditionally on the system side, whether that's Linux administrators or network admins.

DevOps is the practice of operations and development engineers, participating together through the entire service lifecycle, from the design and development process all the way to production support.

We like to break it down into five levels Values, Principles, Methods, Practices, and Tools. 

<ul>
<li>Values</li>
  <ul>
<li>Culture: Well, DevOps is often thought of as a technology problem, in reality, it's a cultural and business problem. Early on in IT organizations, we split teams into two majors groups. Development, they were charged with creating features. And operations they were charged with maintaining stability. Walls formed around these silos due to their different goals. Now, today, after this pattern has had a long time to metastasize, these groups don't speak the same language and they don't have mutual understanding.

</li>
<li> Automation:  Automation is like an accelerator that allows you to control your systems and your applications </li>
<li> Measurement: DevOps strongly advises you to measure key metrics across the organization. Look for things like MTTR, the Mean Time to Recovery or cycle time, look for costs, revenue, even something like employee satisfaction. </li>
  <li> Sharing:  Sharing ideas and problems is the heart of collaboration</li>
</ul>
<li> Principles: The most respected set of principles is called The Three Ways. </li>
